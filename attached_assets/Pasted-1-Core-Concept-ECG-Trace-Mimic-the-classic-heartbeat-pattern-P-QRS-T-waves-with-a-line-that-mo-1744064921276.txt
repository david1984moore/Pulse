1. Core Concept
ECG Trace: Mimic the classic heartbeat pattern (P, QRS, T waves) with a line that moves across the screen from left to right.
Follow-Through: After the main trace completes, add a subtle "echo" or fading trail to give it a sense of momentum and realism.
2. Implementation Options
Option A: HTML5 Canvas (Web-Based)
Tools: JavaScript with <canvas> or a library like p5.js.
Steps:
Setup Canvas: Create a canvas element sized to your animation area.
Draw the Trace: Use a sine wave or predefined points to simulate the ECG pattern (e.g., small bump for P, sharp peak for QRS, gentle curve for T).
Example: context.beginPath(); context.moveTo(x, y); context.lineTo(x + 1, y + Math.sin(t) * amplitude);
Animate: Use requestAnimationFrame to update the x-position of the trace, shifting it left to right.
Follow-Through: Draw a semi-transparent duplicate of the trace behind the main line, offset slightly and fading over time (reduce alpha in each frame).
Clearing: Clear the canvas partially or use a trailing rectangle to erase older parts of the line, keeping the animation smooth.
Pros: Lightweight, customizable, works on any modern browser.
Cons: Requires manual math for smooth curves.
Option B: SVG + CSS Animation (Web-Based)
Tools: SVG <path> with CSS or SMIL animations.
Steps:
Create Path: Define an SVG path that mimics an ECG pattern (e.g., <path d="M0 100 Q50 50 100 100 T200 100" />).
Animate: Use CSS @keyframes to shift the pathâ€™s stroke or position (e.g., stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset for a drawing effect).
Follow-Through: Layer a second <path> with reduced opacity and a slight delay (e.g., animation-delay: 0.2s).
Loop: Set animation-iteration-count: infinite.
Pros: Declarative, easier to tweak visually.
Cons: Less control over real-time data integration.
Option C: Mobile Frameworks (SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose, Flutter)
SwiftUI (iOS):
Use Path to draw the ECG line dynamically.
Animate with withAnimation and a timer to update the x-coordinate.
Add a shadow or secondary Path with a fade effect for follow-through.
Jetpack Compose (Android):
Use Canvas composable to draw lines.
Animate with LaunchedEffect and a coroutine to move the trace.
Layer a gradient or alpha-blended line for the trail.
Flutter:
Custom CustomPainter to draw the ECG wave.
Use AnimationController to drive the movement.
Overlay a fading trail with Canvas.drawPath and decreasing opacity.
Pros: Native performance, smooth integration with app UI.
Cons: Platform-specific code unless using Flutter.
Option D: Game Engine (Unity, Godot)
Unity:
Use a LineRenderer to draw the ECG trace.
Update vertex positions in a script to animate the line.
Add a particle system or secondary LineRenderer with a gradient material for follow-through.
Godot:
Use Line2D or ImmediateGeometry for the trace.
Animate with GDScript or a shader.
Add a fading duplicate line or trail effect with a shader.
Pros: High performance, great for complex animations.
Cons: Overkill for simple apps.
3. Adding Realism
Randomness: Add slight variations to the wave height or timing to mimic a real heartbeat.
Speed Control: Tie the animation speed to a variable (e.g., user input or simulated heart rate).
Color Gradient: Use a gradient (e.g., green to transparent) for the follow-through effect.
