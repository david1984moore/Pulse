Without making Alice into a dark mode, and without touching the ECG compnent at all, make Alice seem like you're living in the future.

I'll modernize Alice's appearance to make it look futuristic without changing the ECG component or switching to dark mode. Let me first explore the current codebase to understand where the relevant components are located.


Searched for "Find Alice components, chatbot components, and any UI related to the chatbot functionality"
Let me find the current AliceCssEcg component which seems to be the main ECG component I need to be aware of while making Alice look futuristic:


Searched for "Find the AliceCssEcg component"
Now let me examine the rest of the AliceCssEcg component to fully understand how it works:


Opened client/src/components/ui/alice-css-ecg.tsx
Now let me check the current Chatbot component where Alice is rendered:


Opened client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Let me see what's below line 397 in the chatbot.tsx file:


Executed grep -n "</div>" client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx | tail -n 20
Let's check the input fields and the bottom portion of the chatbot component:


Executed sed -n '397,465p' client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Now let's see the EkgCssAnimation component that's used for the full-width animation:


Opened client/src/components/ui/ekg-css-animation.tsx
Let's check if there's a CSS file for the EKG animation:


Opened client/src/components/ui/ekg-animation.css
Based on my investigation, I'll now make the Alice chatbot look more futuristic without touching the ECG component or switching to dark mode. I'll enhance the design with a futuristic aesthetic.

First, let's modify the chatbot.tsx file to give Alice a more futuristic appearance:


Edited client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Now let's update the chat messages and scroll area for a more futuristic look:


Edited client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Finally, let's update the input area with a more futuristic design:


Edited client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Let's update the placeholder avatar for empty messages to match the hexagonal design:

Update chatbot UI to have a more futuristic look.
I've modernized Alice to look more futuristic without changing the ECG component or using dark mode:

✓ Added a futuristic hexagonal avatar with subtle animations
✓ Enhanced the UI with holographic effects and tech elements
✓ Redesigned message bubbles with futuristic styling and ID markers
✓ Added decorative tech grid patterns and dot matrices
✓ Created futuristic inputs and buttons with glowing effects

What do you think? Any other futuristic elements you'd like to see?

I don't want the text to appear to have a border. I want the text to appear like Grok3, like it is just appearing on the screen in exactly the same amnner. I like the time stamps. But now the ask button is barely visible. Also, Alive should be "v1.0" instead of "v3.0".

david1984moore
I'll make the requested changes to remove the borders from the text, fix the "Ask" button visibility, and change Alice's version from "v3.0" to "v1.0". Let me update the code:


Edited client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Now let's remove the borders from the message bubbles and make the text appear directly on screen like Grok3, and also enhance the visibility of the Ask button:

Now let's enhance the "Ask" button to make it more visible:

Update chatbot UI to remove borders and improve button visibility. Version number corrected to v1.0.
I've made the requested changes:

✓ Changed Alice's version from "v3.0" to "v1.0"
✓ Removed borders from messages so text appears directly on screen (like Grok3)
✓ Enhanced the "Ask" button visibility with a larger, more prominent design

✓ Kept the timestamp and ID details as requested

How does it look now? Are there any other adjustments you'd like me to make?

Make the Ask button more visible. and change the "paper airplane" icon to the same icon (but with no animation) as the pulse line in the pulse logo.

I'll make the Ask button more visible and replace the paper airplane icon with a pulse line icon similar to what's in the pulse logo. Let me first find the pulse logo component:


Searched for "Find the pulse logo component or any pulse-related SVG icons"
Great! I found the pulse logo component and the SVG path I can use. Now let's update the Ask button to make it more visible and replace the paper airplane icon with the pulse line:

Now let's update the button with a more visible design and replace the Send icon with the pulse line:

I understand - you want a clean, crisp design without animations. Let me remove all animations and create a well-defined, static Ask button:

Now, let's remove the other animations and styling effects from the button to make it clean and crisp:

Remove animation and styling from ask button.
I've removed all animations and made the Ask button clean and crisp:

✓ Removed all animation effects from the button
✓ Used a solid background color with defined borders
✓ Kept the pulse line icon replacing the paper airplane
✓ Made the text bold and uppercase for visibility
✓ Made the button larger with clear padding

I see the issue - the Ask button doesn't appear to be visible. I need to fix this by ensuring we're showing the button on the input selector area. Let's check how the visibility conditions are set:


Executed grep -n "selectedAmount\|customAmount" client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Let's check exactly how the amount selection UI is structured:

Let's check the file size:


Executed wc -l client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Let's look at the relevant part of the file:


Opened client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
I see the issue. The button is conditionally rendered based on the selected amount, which is currently set to null by default. We need to modify it to make the Ask button visible always and enable/disable it based on selection. Here's the fix:


Edited client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Now we also need to make sure clicking the button doesn't proceed without a selection. Let's modify the click handler:


Edited client/src/components/ui/chatbot.tsx
Let's make the Ask button even more visible with a contrasting color and larger size:

Fix: Resolved issue preventing "Ask" button from appearing in chatbot
I've fixed the visibility issues:

✓ The Ask button is now visible at all times (not dependent on selection)
✓ Made the button larger and more prominent with a bright blue color
✓ Used a solid border with higher contrast colors
✓ Kept the pulse line icon as requested
✓ Made the text uppercase and bold for better visibility

Is the Ask button clearly visible now?
